' they were pretty stupid . but nice , i mean . anyway , she walked upright , the way it felt best , but when it came to copulation , that was another matter . there was nobody to copulate with . the little girl wanted to try it with her male-best-bear-friend ( for animals do not live the way people do , you know ) but the he-bear would not even try . 'alas' he said ( you can tell by that he was much more elegant than the other bears , ha ha ) i'm afraid i'd hurt you with my claws because you don't have all the fur that she-bears have . and besides that , you have trouble assuming the proper position because your back legs are too long . and besides that , you don't smell like a bear and i'm afraid my mother would say it was bestiality . ' that's a joke . actually it's race prejudice . the little girl was very lonely and bored . finally after a long time , she browbeat her bear-mother into telling her about her origins , so she decided to go out looking for some people who were not bears . she thought life might be better with them . she said good-bye to her bear-friends and started south , and they all wept and waved their handkerchiefs . the girl was very hardy and woods-wise , since she had been taught by the bears . she traveled all day and slept all night . finally she came to a settlement of people , just like this one , and they took her in . of course she didn't speak people-talk"
