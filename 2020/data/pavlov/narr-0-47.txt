* Anticipating the insights of artificial life, Dick posits a phase transition that he delightfully terms thresholding . Just as liquid water must be heated past the threshold of 100 degrees centigrade if it is to become a gas or cooled below 0 centigrade if it is to solidify, so too must the
undergo a quantitative change if it is to undergo a qualitative change . And this qualitative change entails a change in consciousness such that the self becomes aware of a Möbius strip-like continuity between itself and Christ . Dick deploys the concept of the hologram to make sense of this simultaneously individual and cosmic aspect of human nature, possibly under the influence of psychologist Karl Pribram's holographic model of the brain . For both Pribram and Dick, one of the most salient and suggestive features of the hologram is that each bit or fragment taken from a hologram contains information about the whole . Dick's reference to the Swarm of Bees brain is also resonant with Timothy Leary's notion of the hive mind ,
* Dick's mystical vision or apparent psychosis seems to put him in touch with the eternal feminine . This is one of the many moments when the Exegesis resonates with Daniel Paul Schreber's Memoirs of My Nervous Illness (1903), where the erstwhile high court judge became convinced that his body took on breasts and female genitalia in order to be properly penetrated by the rays of God and to redeem the universe . The fusion with the divine is here conceived (poor choice of word, I know) as a kind of transsexual bliss, a penetration (a repeated word in the Exegesis) by the divine . We should also note Dick's later affirmation of Christianity as the experience of being the intended bride
* One of the great failures of futurism—whether science fiction or professional prognostication—is the fact that few saw anything like the Internet coming . Though Dick opens Galactic Pot-Healer (1969) with a couple of lonely cubicle workers wasting time on a translation game they play through an absurd information network, Dick's fiction was no more predictive on that score than anyone else's . But the Exegesis, here and in many other places, can be seen as an eerie and in some ways optimistic prophecy of our absorption into an all-consuming, endlessly arborizing, weirdly disincarnating information network . With the spread of smart phones, sensors, and GPS devices, the Internet is now reconfiguring physical reality very much the way Dick describes Valis using the world of objects to organize and extend itself as an intentional information system . We still have food, music, and friends (though books are beginning to dissolve), but an increasing chunk of our lives—love and play as much as work and thought—is given over to intensified, cybernetic information processing, what Dick earlier calls the
Though Dick puts a liberating spin on it, his words here also anticipate the grim prophecy of the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, who wrote that the individual has now become
only a pure screen, a switching center for all the networks of influence.
* In this and the subsequent folder, we can feel VALIS (1981) rising on the horizon as specific ideas and even characters in the novel begin to take shape . Messages from the AI Voice intensify in frequency and apparent significance, and a flurry of concepts emerge that Dick will pour into his manuscript, and especially into the Tractates Cryptica Scriptura
* Dick's use of occlusion in this passage, directly correlated with the concept of rebellion against God, shows that he is using the term as a substitute for the more traditional terminology of sin . In this, he is largely in keeping with twentieth-century theologians like Paul Tillich, who emphasized that sin, rather than simply a bad or disobedient deed, is more like an ontological state . In his Systematic Theology, Tillich uses the word estrangement to illustrate this aspect of sin—a term that emphasizes the essential relationship between created and Creator . Dick's term occlusion
* Dick was a passionate, intelligent, and deeply knowledgeable fan of classical, Romantic, and early music . With Bach, Beethoven, and Linda Ronstadt, Dick's most important musical touchstone in the Exegesis is Richard Wagner (1813–1883). Mostly Dick references Parsifal, Wagner's final and most religious opera, which pairs an aestheticized sense of Christian ritual redemption with a world-denying, Schopenhauerian view of Buddhism . In VALIS and the Exegesis, Dick quotes Gurnemanz, a wise Knight who enigmatically describes the environs of the Grail castle to the holy fool Parsifal :
* This is the first explicit mention in the Exegesis of the hidden writing published as an appendix to the novel VALIS . From the Exegesis it is clear that the raw material that Dick would shape into the Tractates was already in existence before the novel itself was written . Some entries of the published Tractates are direct quotations from the AI Voice (including 7 and 9), but beyond these, the published document does not quote the Exegesis so much as refine it, showing, as do subsequent entries, that Dick clearly thought of the Tractates as a distinct document designed for public consumption (and, he no doubt hoped, illumination). Dick struggled with how to integrate the text into his novel, as well as how to think about their relationship . Once the manuscript for VALIS was completed, a few portions of the Tractates
* Dick is most likely referencing Rudolf Otto's comparative study of Meister Eckhart and Sankara, Mysticism East and West: A Comparative Analysis of the Nature of Mysticism (1932). Otto (1869–1937) was a major German scholar of comparative religion who helped introduce the term the holy the sacred (das Heilige) into the field, by which he meant, in his Latin phrase, a mysterium tremendum et fascinans, that is, a mystical presence at once terrifying and alluring (an idea that Dick clearly draws on in other parts of the Exegesis). Master Eckhart (1260–1327) was a Dominican scholar and preacher whose most radical mystical teachings were condemned shortly before he died . Sankara (eighth–ninth century) was one of the most important expositors of Advaita Vedanta or idealist nondualism
* This compelling but cryptic passage represents Dick's recovery of one of Schopenhauer's key aims: salvation from the world of illusion, and the attainment of intuitive access to what Nietzsche, in his early Schopenhauerian phase, saw as the mysterious and Dionysian unity of being that is the unconscious will, whose blind urgings Dick here identifies with God . If the core of the Exegesis is a blissful recovery of intellectual intuition, of gnosis, then a corresponding Schopenhauerian theme that emerges is that our existence in the phenomenal world is an experience of suffering and pain . Human life is a kind of mistake, a detour on the way to life's goal: death . Indeed, a recurrent feature of the lives of mystics is the experience of dejection and depression, understood as distance from God . Such despair occurs repeatedly in the Exegesis and with greater frequency in the later years, as in [90:69]:
When I believe, I am crazy . When I don't believe, I suffer psychotic depression.
* We see not unity but an exploded chaos . Dick sees a world of suffering, including his own, yet Valis offers reintegration through entelechy —the actualization of divine potential akin to the development of an embryo . Shattered, we dwell in an explosion of false categories, divided from the eternal in space and time . Despite this rhetoric of explosion —resonant with the 1971 burglary of Dick's Marin County house and the explosion of his fireproof file cabinet, something like the Big Bang of Valis—the divine reality remains to be integrated through a consciousness willing to go there . Fragments of trash become what Gabriel Mckee calls the
as the most abject or insignificant phenomenon becomes a splinter connected in reality to the One . Here even suffering and evil can be creatively understood as a finger pointing elsewhere—beyond the dispersed consciousness of our splintered selves and toward the collective eternal Noös, a communion of mind that can only be discovered by each of us in our own particularity . This is perhaps a calling in a triple sense: Dick calls—names—the perception of the integrated Noös Valis ,
* Faced with the problem of how to map time and space when they no longer obey the logics of linearity and extension, Dick turns to more virtual models of infodynamics . Note that in this instance information is viewed as an aspect of reality rather than its essence . One of Dick's refrains in his contemplation of 2-3-74 is a line from Wagner's Parsifal :
Here Dick posits a continuity between all time and space through recourse to a higher order of abstraction: the informational aspect of reality . But Dick avoids the usual opposition between information
* The difference between is does underlies a good deal of Dick's theorizing as he navigates between traditional philosophical questions about the essence of things (ontology) and a process paradigm based on genetics, informatics, and cybernetic systems theory . Within this latter paradigm, with its heuristic emphasis on process, experiment, and rules of thumb, philosophical questions about the true nature of things just get in the way of exploring the possibilities and problems in any given situation . After all, the skepticism that Dick also favors can always undermine notions of God and Being, but has a tougher time denying the evident fact that, even if you cannot know what the world really is, you still have to deal with it . And dealing with it means that, on some level anyway, your options are open because you have choice . Process leads toward pragmatism—the philosophical equivalent of the handyman who recurs throughout Dick's fiction . In the following folder [6:44], Dick will make this point more explicit . Acknowledging there that truth is plastic—even and especially in a metaphysical zone like the bardo—one still faces the most concrete of questions :
* Here Dick identifies his thinking with the Marxist idea that history is a dialectic that will culminate in communist revolution . In part, Dick is attempting to engage the leftist literary critics whose interest in his work in the 1970s both pleased and unnerved him . At the same time, Dick's thinking already employs dualistic motifs that cast history as a dialectical conflict between the forces of Empire and those who struggle for freedom—what is described elsewhere in the Exegesis as the struggle between God and Satan . We should also note Dick's frequent identification of true Christianity as revolutionary and Christ as a revolutionary figure . In this way, Dick retrieves the historical link that has often bound together rebellious quasi-gnostic movements, like the Cathars or the Heresy of the Free Spirit, with forms of insurgent political populism and indeed communism . Giordano Bruno, one of the other heretics
* What an odd, and incredibly paranoid, idea . And a popular one . We see something similar with the black monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). We see an even closer version of this extraterrestrial mind-control computer in John A . Keel's The Eighth Tower (1975), a book that Dick easily could have read . The eighth tower is Keel's mythical way of referring to the machinelike origin-beacon of something he calls the superspectrum, an electromagnetic spectrum of physical and metaphysical energies that produces all the occult and paranormal phenomena found in folklore and the history of religions—from the angels and demons of medieval lore to the Big Foot and UFOs of today . For Keel, this same technology also produces the devil theories
* Just as the Exegesis responds to Dick's calling, so readers of the Exegesis may be called on to investigate Dick's claims, to test them through what B. Alan Wallace dubs contemplative science . This means that, along with Dick, we must be wary of treating our investigations as anything more than models of reality . The Son discussed elsewhere by Dick is born out of the immaculate conception of thought—the removal or emptying of previous thought formations . This path of contemplative science can be hard going—Dick asks us to consider the idea that our sense of historical ground does not exist, where nothing important has changed since ancient Rome . Humans suffer, are exploited by large-scale institutions, grow old, become ever more confused, and die . Buddhism describes this as Samsara, the
* Despite what we are repeatedly told by the dogmatic debunkers, there is a rich and impressive scientific literature on precognition . Dean Radin of the Institute of Noetic Sciences has been one of the real pioneers here, particularly around what he calls presentiment ,
* When W. Y. Evans-Wentz first prepared the Bardo Thödol for its English edition in 1927, he called it The Tibetan Book of the Dead in order, one suspects, to link it to the popular Egyptian Book of the Dead . Dick owned the 1960 edition of the text, which had been reissued with a new introduction by Carl Jung . A funerary text designed to be read at the bedside of the dead, the Bardo Thödol is more accurately called Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State . The intermediate state in question is the bardo, the spectral halls of transformation that lie between the death of the body and the almost inevitable rebirth of one's mind-stream: most souls are made so variously terrified and lustful by the apparitions that they are inevitably sucked back for another round . For the Buddhist practitioner, release lies in recognizing the emptiness of these projections, which are nothing other than one's own mind . Dick's insight here—that the bardo is actually our world—is perfectly in sync with traditional teachings, as the intermediate state
* Here Dick suggests the radically liberatory possibility that reality, the Tao, the Palm Tree Garden, can break through the present if you destroy prior thought formations, including those that separate you from the One . Here Dick resonates with Joyce's Stephen Dedalus, who wished only to awaken from the nightmare of history, an awakening later perhaps achieved by Joyce in Finnegans Wake . Readers familiar with Zen, or Korzybski's notion that stillness in which the divine can manifest in Quaker or Vedic traditions, will recognize some of the practices appropriate for a world mediated and constituted by the multiple objectified mistakes of language and other previous thought formations . In this sense Valis
( Mt 5:17) by overturning prior concepts like so many tables in the temple.
( Mt 5:20). Righteousness here is anything but self-righteousness . It is instead the humility and practice necessary to silence the mind in order to perceive reality, a causal field
* Dick's holograph is notably erratic throughout this folder, pulsing in waves of ecstasy and calm . Given the manic diagramming throughout the folder (a full-page example is included in this volume's insert), as well as his invocation of Diana and the fairies, this may well represent the superdope
* As noted earlier, Mircea Eliade was a well-known and much-read scholar of comparative religion who was at his professional height when Dick read him in the 1970s . Here he is referring to one of Eliade's major early books, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (1951), a massive survey of the anthropological literature as it existed around 1950, organized around Eliade's own glosses and comparative reflections . Eliade focuses especially on the initiatory illness, magical powers, healing function, poetic gifts, and mystical experiences of the shaman and, perhaps most of all, on the shaman's role as a psychopomp . Eliade also emphasizes the quest for the recovery of sacred time before the Fall
* Another new mood is here announced in the Exegesis: a tragic dialectics . Dick has come across Coleridge's understanding of tragedy, which adapts the early ideas of F.W.J . Schelling . Schelling held that the essence of tragedy consists in a collision between the tragic hero, who is free, and fate, which is the limitation of freedom, the realm of necessity . The sublimity of tragedy consists in the demonstration of freedom in the confrontation with that which destroys it . This is what we see, for example, in the tragedy of Oedipus . Tragedy is here linked to the idea of suffering leading to an experience of truth, as when Aeschylus says repeatedly in the Oresteia ,
These tragic insights might also be linked to Dick's repeated references to Euripides' Bacchae, in particular the collision between King Pentheus (bad) and the god Dionysos (good). These also look forward to a closing passage in this collection where Dick describes the Exegesis as a collision between himself and
* In this act of perceiving the ultra-thought, Dick is very close to another California sage, Franklin Merrell Wolff . Wolff, a Harvard mathematician who gave up a position at Stanford in order to study in India in the 1930s, deduced a series of axioms about human nature that follow from his first axiom: beholding nothing but itself, which is palpably not an object but is experienced as fact . Wolff's experiences of recognition are instructive for comprehending (and therefore experiencing) the invisible landscape of Dick's epic quest . So too does Dick's passage here reflect the other aspect of this inner beholding—"reality as knowledge ."Once one has looked within, one contemplates external reality and inner reality as the same thing . Astronomer Carl Sagan repeated biologist Julian Huxley's phrase that
* Like a lot of readers, I consider Dick an idea-man rather than a stylist . Generally he doesn't write sentences that hold within them whole worlds; rather, his collective work has to be taken together to add up to something—at which point, as in Mark Danielewski's House of Leaves, the House of Dick is bigger on the inside than out . But this sentence is one of Dick's most exquisite and enigmatic and feels full of wisdom, even as I'm not sure what it means no matter how many times I read it . The whiplash words, of course, are yet accurate.
* Dick's Christianity is sometimes revolutionary; here it becomes Marxist . This is not quite the leftist Christianity of liberation theology, which was hitting its stride in the '70s . Dick's dialectical materialistic mysticism instead puts him in line with continental thinkers like Herbert Marcuse and Walter Benjamin, whose visionary angel of history sees what we experience as time and progress as a mounting pile of wreckage (or kipple). Dick also anticipates the contemporary return to Christianity found in continental philosophers like Alain Badiou and Slavoj Žižek . Central here is the notion of event . Dick elsewhere describes Christ as
* These cosmic flip-flops are not sandals worn to an Orange County beach, but logic gates at the basis of computers, wherein the change of a single bit at a single gate can alter the entire meaning of a message . Dick's encounter with the Tao, reality as it is, occurs in perhaps equal measure to the planet's historical transformation into digital information and to his own horror of and fascination with simulation . By conceptualizing VALIS as both the Tao—an ancient model of two-state flux between yin and yang—and DNA—a double helical molecule organized in base pairs according to a triplet code—Dick again integrates the seemingly antithetical traditions of modern science and traditional mysticism even as he harmonizes
Dick wrote in A Scanner Darkly, speculating that as explorers once sailed west in order to circle the world to India, we might sail into the future only to shipwreck on the shores of Jesus's crucifixion two thousand years ago . Of course, the explorers didn't reach India, they reached America, an altogether different version of the past that came to be called the future . By the same token, we might suppose Dick's career was round as well; as he wrote his way into the future of A Scanner Darkly, VALIS, and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, the mainland of science fiction receding behind him, he saw before him an altered version of his strange novels of the fifties, all the more singular for how they contextualized his cracked vision not in outer space but in the new American suburbia as saturated with madness as its front lawns were with water and fertilizer . Setting aside the cosmic and religious preoccupations of God and infinity, in a purely literary sense Dick's contemplation of the infinite
* This and the next two folders are largely taken up with examinations of the following G-2 dream, and thus with various conspiracy theories concerning the Xerox missive, Soviet espionage, psychic weapons, and the like . In this they resemble a good deal of the nine-tenths of the Exegesis that is not represented in our abridged edition . While such paranoid speculations might delight fans of the cold war spy thriller or David Icke, they quickly become monotonous and, as Lawrence Sutin has written, produce
* Metaphysical paradoxes abound in these sections: first the comments on the reintegration of the divine and trash, and then this equation of defeat and victory . The latter image, illustrating multiple reversals, is the more complex: Christianity defeated the Empire with the conversion of Constantine and the adoption of Christianity as the Roman state religion, but the Empire won by reversing the early church's anti-authoritarianism . Then the church covertly won by its preservation of a hidden minority of true, rebellious Christians . Furthermore, the image of the sliced-up fish echoes the early church father Tertullian's statement that divine trash
* These wonderful passages on Beethoven almost make one wish Dick had been a music critic, and if one senses more authority on behalf of classical than pop, well, who needed another rock writer in 1979? Why not someone to make a case for the modern relevance of Beethoven, Bach, Mahler, and Schubert? Among other music he mentions in the Exegesis we find Eno (Discreet Music), the Beatles (
through which God speaks to him), David Bowie (more the cinematic Bowie than the musical one), Neil Young (though he doesn't know it's Young, referring to a cover version by a band called Prelude), and Paul McCartney, on whose first solo album he blames a psychotic journey ,
* Nineteenth-century writer Thomas Carlyle, writing of his own Valis-like experience in his semi-autobiographical Sartor Resartus, asks ,
Exhausting the quest to describe the extraordinary unity of what is, we can focus our awareness on ordinary reality and explore not only the
but the unmistakable actuality of the unity of our subjective experience . In focusing on the unity of self, we glimpse the unity of reality . For Dick, this discovery is the occasion for the world flipping inside out, reverting . His Palm Tree Garden is akin to the Kingdom of Heaven in the Gospel of Luke—a way of training the mind to perceive both the eternal and the particular aspects of experience, both external reality and internal subjection . Search for this inner kingdom continuously, and we no longer see simply
but instead perceive the immanent and eternal order of the cosmos as the unity of within and without . This possibility shifts the burden of Dick's inquiry—and it shifts often, as if dancing—to an inquiry, not into the nature of Valis and the essence
* This dream spawned the fractured fairy tale The Divine Invasion (1981), a broken novel leaking visionary gems . One of these is the holoscope, a layered, three-dimensional holographic Bible, pulsing with red and gold, that can reveal fresh messages depending on the reader's interactive angle of view . In some ways a model for the Exegesis itself, the holoscope is also drawn from the Exegesis, or at least from the hypnagogic vision Dick records a few pages after this apocalyptic dream, on [48:839]: a luminous red-and-gold tetragrammaton (YHWH), resembling the plasmate, that pulses along to the repeated phrase
Less groovy is this second coming dream, which drips with the satanic panic and homophobia popular among the more rabid of America's fringe Christians . Dick sometimes shared in this deeply unfortunate strain of the Christian imagination: a tendency to demonize made possible in part by the concept of a conspiratorial Satan . Elsewhere in these late folders, Dick pines for the return of the rightful king who will be recognized only by the elect; in March 1981, he records a dream in which
is finally in total control and
the separation of the sheep from the goats has begun.
* The work of Martin Heidegger becomes progressively more important to Dick as the Exegesis unfolds . Dick has a sense of Heidegger's question of Being and its link to the question of time through Dasein, which is Heidegger's term of art for the human being and the key concern of Being and Time (1927). Dick shows an understanding of some of the key concepts in Being and Time, especially thrown-ness (Geworfenheit), anxiety (Angst), and uncanniness (Unheimlichkeit). Dick also references the concept of authenticity, the condition for which is Heidegger's notion of being-toward-death, a crucial element as well in the existential psychology that influenced Dick . Dick shows some sense of what is at stake for Heidegger in the recovery of Parmenides' fragment
* There is a rich and sophisticated literature drawing parallels between quantum physics and various forms of mystical experience . Most trace this literature back to the appearance of Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics in 1975, the book to which Dick is alluding in this passage . Capra gave these parallels real cultural traction via his eloquent writing, his own revelatory altered states of consciousness and energy, and, perhaps most of all, his ingenious illustrations demonstrating the complementarity of mind and matter . Having said that, it must also be observed that the physics/mysticism complementarity has a much longer history . The American anomalous writer Charles Fort, for example, was already naming the teleporting (a word that he coined) behavior of subatomic quanta a matter of witchcraft in the early 1930s . The pioneering quantum theorist Niels Bohr was so impressed with the similarities between the double nature of light (at once particle and wave) and Chinese Taoism that he chose the yin-yang symbol for his coat of arms . And the physicist Wolfgang Pauli engaged in a quarter-century correspondence with C.G . Jung in order to pursue a similar both-and vision of physics and psychology—a friendship, moreover, that produced one of the most productive parapsychological notions of all time: synchronicity . All of this is wrapped up in Dick 's
* This is the mystical, even paranormal, flip side of the postmodern insight . In a world in which almost everything is constructed, plastic, and malleable, what (or who) is doing all of this constructing and shaping? Here Dick takes a cue from anthropology (the
