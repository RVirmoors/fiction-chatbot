It is not ,
I am very sorry ,
Goodbye, excuse me ,
Carry on, please ,
Who are you looking for? There's nobody here . There's only me.
Ah, Janet!
How do you do? I must explain my sudden appearance . I am from another time.
How do you do? I must explain my sudden appearance . I am from another time.
Who are you!
I am from another time, from the future ,
Is this a joke?
I am from the future.
How else do you think I appeared out of the air?
People cannot very well walk through walls, now can they?
Take me to your leader.
I am from the future.
I'm lost.
F'godsakes, go out in the hall, will you?
He's not here ,
Happy Perseverance, Madam Chiang ,
Oh, I couldn't ,
But that's different ,
Cal's in there ,
I couldn't go in there.
Are you French?
I've never been to France ,
I often thought I'dwell, I just haven't been.
Look! There's my boyfriend Cal ,
Who did your hair?
Who streaked your hair so beautifully?
I can't possibly go with you ,
There's Cal, there's New York, there's my work, New York in springtime, I can't leave, my life is here ,
We'll get you a leave from work.
So that's why it doesn't fit ,
Boys, I've got one.
You mean it's not washable? )
Janet, stop joking
I do not understand you . Why not play? Nobody is going to be hurt and nobody is going to blame you; why not take advantage?
You fake, you rotten fake!
If we make perhaps an hypothetical assumption
Go to hell ,
Put your clothes on.
Perhaps about this sex business you can tell me ,
why is this hypothetical assumption
Why the devil do you run around in the nude!
you must understand . I'm far from home; I want to keep myself cheerful, eh? And about this men thing, you must remember that to me they are a particularly foreign species; one can make love with a dog, yes? But not with something so unfortunately close to oneself . You see how I can feel this way?
Oh, my goodness ,
You'll tell me what to do ,
won't you?
Why didn't they send someone who knew what he was doing!
