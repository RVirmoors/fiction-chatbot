oiseaux = birds.
Do you like it here?
Our guest wants to know if you like living here ,
detest women who don't know how to be women.
I don't ,
understand where the devil they all go on Saturday mornings . You'd think they were trying to catch up with the sun.
I dreamed I was learning to use a rifle ,
The hell with it.
I said the hell with it ,
I want to show you something.
Show, then ,
I can't read this ,
I know the language but not the context ,
I can't judge this, child.
I don't have a teacher ,
I do it myself, out of the book.
Then the book's wrong ,
You know math!
No, no, I'm just an amateur, just an amateur ,
The life so short, the craft so long to learn ,
I'm in love with someone in school ,
Oh, sure ,
You're too young.
Why don't you smile? God loves you!
I'm not a girl, I'm a genius ,
Sure, washing floors ,
I have you ,
What the hell is she fussing about this time?
I never had a thought that wasn't yours.
What are you getting upset about?
Oho, I got my kiss! I got my kiss!
See, it's a woman's world, after all.
Would you like to live like that?
That's irrelevant, because I'm a man.
Think what power it gives you over them.
Don't worry, Laura . I know you're really very sweet and gentle underneath.
You're strong, like an earth mother.
You're so beautiful when you're angry.
What have you learned from all that reading?
Shall I tell you something?
I'm in love ,
Tell me about Whileaway ,
Well, tell me ,
She's called Vittoria ,
Oh my goodness ,
You are kidding me.
now then, now then.
I love you, I love you ,
Neverdon'tI can'tleave me!
I want to get out of my damned clothes ,
