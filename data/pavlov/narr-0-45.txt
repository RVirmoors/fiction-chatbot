Jerry panted, trying to get his ugly greasy hair from his eyes and blinking . No time . Yeah . Jerry stood by the boy, gasping . Shit! he yelled at the boy in fury.
His face writhed . The boy, lit tle Ratass, looked miserable and twitched guiltily.
Charles Freck explained, knowing his idiocy, his own equal fuckup, great as the boy's and equally lethal . His failure as a full-grown man to respond right . But he wanted to justify it anyhow, as the boy did, in words.
Jerry muttered as they entered the dark interior of the house.
But his voice was subdued now, not angry, just low and perplexed . He put his hand on Ratass's head and gave him a sharp smack.
* Logos is an important concept that litters the pages of the Exegesis . An ancient Greek word with a wide variety of meanings, Logos can mean word, speech, reason (in Latin ratio) or giving an account of something . For Heraclitus, to whom Dick frequently refers, Logos is the universal law that governs the cosmos, of which most human beings are somnolently ignorant . Dick certainly has this latter meaning in mind, but most importantly, Logos refers to the opening of the Gospel of John, which invokes the word that becomes flesh in the person of Christ . The human faculty for the intuition of Logos is nous (or noös, as Dick transliterates it) or intellection ,
† Neoplatonism is crossed with thermodynamics to provide a framework for Dick to think through his experiences here . The entire universe can be comprehended as subject to an imperative: more entropy! While entropy is usually associated with the negativity of disorder, here it functions as something like a revelation: the bare bones, so to speak, of our world are revealed . And while the revelation is a regression, it enables an insight into the nature of reality . The divine, Atman ,
* Until the mid-1960s, Dick's novels explored isolation, entropy, and psychological withdrawal . But with Ubik (1966), his work becomes progressively more concerned with redemption and rebirth . After a team of anti-telepaths is injured in an explosion, the novel develops a dreamlike quality inspired by The Tibetan Book of the Dead . As the reality around them devolves, the characters begin to succumb to entropy themselves . A magical cure-all product begins to show up in advertisements: Ubik, which comes in an aerosol spray can and promises to combat the forces of encroaching chaos . Ubik is clearly an allegory for the Christian concept of grace; author Michael Bishop has written that Ubik is
* This word information has become so commonplace that it is important to mark out its history here . Dick is writing a quarter of a century after Claude Shannon published his Mathematical Theory of Communication with Warren Weaver, wherein he defined the quantity of surprise value contained in any message as its entropy . Shannon named this value entropy because he was using equations drawn from the thermodynamic measure of entropy in a system—Maxwell's equations . The paradox here—one that Dick grappled with—is presented by the fact that information, whose etymology suggests the existence of a pattern or form ,
† The paradox of entropy as a measure of disorder and order is, for Dick, temporarily overcome . It is only through the breakdown of his ordinary reality that he can be in-formed by the suprasensual reality of the divine letter: the Logos . Here, as in the famous opening of the Gospel of John—"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God"—language becomes an active agent that is actually prior to material reality . John 1:1 is additionally instructive because of what information theory would describe as the sentence's redundancy . The semantic content of In the beginning reiterates the line's formal content, since In the beginning is indeed in the beginning of the gospel.
is, of course, in words, so here too the signal repeats itself through its own self-reference . In this passage Dick is treating this threefold redundancy as the Logos itself, out of which any message at all might emerge . Thus, when Dick receives this
it is felt as salvation . The question of whether Valis is signal or noise is abstracted another level, as information from the future
* Here Dick acknowledges that, as he comes to terms with 2-3-74, he can choose different maps for his exploration, since
He regards the present as a continual informational print-out in which he nonetheless and simultaneously has free will, a perception that is in accord with the thinking of physicist Erwin Schrödinger, one of the chief architects of the informatic paradigm Dick is experiencing . Schrödinger, whose idea of the code-script in DNA gave birth to the concept of the genetic code, grapples in What Is Life? with the simultaneously mechanistic and free characteristic of human experience :
Notice that to perceive this twofold nature of the human being requires an act of contemplation on Dick's part :
I am free to consider it, digest and understand it, and, with its assistance, act on it.
* When he wrote this sentence, Dick sat less than ten miles away from Disneyland, a geographic synchronicity that reminds us how regional a writer Dick was . Unlike most California writers, however, he bridged the two hemispheres of the bipolar Golden State . Before moving to the tacky conservative sprawl of Orange County, Dick lived for decades in the Bay Area, absorbing the lefty bohemia of Berkeley and Marin County . In 1973 he wrote Stanislaw Lem :
* The year 1964 was a bad one for Dick . Burned out after writing seven novels in twelve months, Dick suffered a serious bout of depression . Writer's block and two bad acid trips took their toll . After separating from his wife and leaving bucolic Point Reyes, Dick got an apartment in East Oakland, a gritty neighborhood he referred to as East Gak-ville.
* In the Exegesis, one of the great themes of Dick's work—memory—is being reconsidered, if not radically recast . The theme of memory runs from In Milton Lumky Territory to Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep? to A Scanner Darkly; up until the Exegesis, Dick's work has formed a multivolume epic that might be called
In this work, memory serves as the nexus between reality and humanity, but in the Exegesis Dick's past and future seem to bleed into the present, creatively and psychologically, and one feels his effort to make memory not so much irrelevant as meaningless, maybe even nonsensical . It is no longer part of humanity's cosmic DNA—the Lincoln robot in We Can Build You is as human as the real Lincoln not because he looks and acts like a real Lincoln, but because he remembers like one . Dick suspects that the person he remembers being for the previous ten years was a secondary
* It should be noted that everything Dick describes in this passage is only a slightly crazier version of something that every novelist experiences—the sense that he or she is not creating the work but someone or something else is . (Or as Dick has put it earlier ,
* Dick's experience of 2-3-74 has sometimes been interpreted as auditory and visual hallucinations, perhaps induced by repeated transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), or temporary strokes . We know that he was experiencing dangerously high blood pressure during this period, so a stroke would not be unlikely . If a stroke did occur, some of the changes he recorded in his personality in 1974 suggest that the neural circuitry normally associated with his conscious mind was reconfigured, possibly in ways that strengthened the connections between consciousness and what recent research in neuroscience has been calling
Distinct from the Freudian unconscious, the adaptive unconscious catches the overflow of sensations and perceptions too abundant to be processed through the bottleneck of conscious attention . Far from surfacing only in dreams, it is constantly at work to help set priorities, direct attention, and change behaviors in ways adaptive to the environment . Dick's observation that he had become more shrewd
* We all know the Christian fish, multiplied and mutated across millions of automobile bumpers in an endless ideological war . Sometimes the icon includes the word, the Greek word for fish and an acrostic—used by early Christians along with the symbol—of the phrase
Popular accounts of often suggest that the sign was once used by persecuted Christians to recognize one another—a believer would draw one arc of the fish, which a fellow acolyte would then complete . Though this account inspired Dick, there is no historical evidence for such secret winks . More relevant is the symbol's modern revival by the countercultural Jesus Movement, for whose adherents the symbol replaced the stark rectilinear cross and invoked an alternative Christianity, radical and earthy . In Orange County, Dick was surrounded by the ambient vibes of Jesus Freakery, an originally Californian movement whose local avatar was the remarkably named Lonnie Frisbee . By 1974 Frisbee's youth evangelism and surf's up
* In the Phaedo, Plato recounts the death of Socrates, which is famously administered by drinking hemlock . Socrates' enigmatic final words are ,
* In his 2006 article
* The reference here is to Aristophanes' speech in Plato's Symposium, where the playwright explains the origin of love (eros) with the myth that the first human beings were akin to conjoined twins of opposite sex—bound face to face, hands to hands, feet to feet—who became separated; the fire of desire flows from the attempt to retrieve our lost unity . Here as elsewhere, the Exegesis can be seen as a long tug-of-war with Plato . There are constant references to Plato's theory of anamnesis or recollection, which is the remembrance of the forms—the pure core of reality perceived within the soul through the activity of intellection or nous—that were allegedly forgotten due to the painful trauma of our birth . Dick also refers to Plato's analogy of the cave from Republic, and to the true universe as idea or form (eidos), of which phenomenal reality is a mirror, or scanner, through which we see darkly . Later in the Exegesis, Dick also finds reason to harshly reject Plato, who, he will declare, is
180 degrees wrong.
* Ursula Le Guin (1929-) is an SF and fantasy writer from Berkeley . Though she and Dick were nearly the same age and attended the same high school, the two never met, but they did correspond as friends and colleagues throughout the 1970s . In February 1981, Le Guin gave a lecture at Emory University attended by author and critic Michael Bishop . Le Guin made some disparaging comments about Dick's later work, specifically the treatment of women in VALIS (1981). Le Guin wondered aloud if Dick was immanent mind
* In this and the following letters, Dick explores Christianity as an ancient mystery cult . The various mysteries of the Greco-Roman period were characterized by secret and mystical rituals in which initiates sacramentally relived their god's experiences, which often involved death and rebirth . The central rites of the early Christian church bear much similarity to these rituals, particularly baptism, the agape or love feast, and the Eucharist . Indeed, in the Eastern Orthodox Church the sacraments are still referred to as mysteries.
* Cultural critic, rock-and-roll journalist, and founder of Crawdaddy magazine, Paul Williams (1948-) is a singularly important figure in the second half of Dick's life . Besides giving a copy of Dick's The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch to both John Lennon and psychedelic guru Timothy Leary, Williams wrote the profile
* In many of Dick's stories, collectors build encapsulated re-creations of places that once held special meaning for them . In Now Wait for Last Year (1966), Virgil Ackerman re-creates the city of his childhood, Wash-35 (Dick lived in Washington, D.C., in 1935). For Dick, these nostalgic places serve as staging grounds for a ceaseless replay of events, lovingly composed, in the words of critic Fredric Jameson ,
* Dick speaks often, as here, of his 2-3-74 experience as a kind of healing, specifically a healing of neural circuits . Contemporary neural science is providing the scientific explanation for what Dick sensed intuitively . Recent work in neuroscience has found that the brain is much more plastic than previously supposed, a fact that Oliver Sacks demonstrates throughout The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and other accounts of patients who have suffered brain injury or trauma . In his recent work, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio calls the narrating voice of consciousness the autobiographical self.
* Interpreting his repurposed neural circuits as the emergence of a mind connected to all other minds, Dick here is quite right to note that the awakened mind (which I hypothesize is the adaptive unconscious )
* Here Dick ponders the notion of the Kingdom found in Luke 17 alongside a Sufi insight . In Luke 17:20, Jesus tells the Pharisees that
In other words, the Kingdom of Heaven cannot be found by inspecting empirical reality or by watching for signs of its imminent arrival . So too in the Vedic tradition one finds the practice of
which looks at the world and recalls—over and over—that the divine is
In Luke 17:21, Jesus follows his first negation with another :
In other words, the Kingdom of Heaven is neither here there precisely because it is not the spatial, external world . Being neither here nor there, the Kingdom is what Dick would describe as ubiquitous . Hence Jesus then asks us to behold, to look with awareness :
We are directed to behold what St. Theresa called our interior castle, our consciousness, the virtual space of contemplation . If we follow William Penn and
we find, in the contemplative tradition Dick is writing in and through, that within without
* The Acts of the Apostles from the New Testament tells the story of the early church, focusing largely on the ministry of the apostle Paul . Dick speaks frequently about the presence of Acts material
* Here Dick provides a concrete analogy that helps illuminate his generally Platonic take on orthogonal time . The eternal forms sit on a circular drum and stamp themselves onto a moving strip of time, literally informing the linear flow and creating the two-source time that we misrecognize as a single fusion of novelty and repetition, change and return . Essentially, Dick is describing a Platonic typewriter—one thinks in particular of the IBM Selectric model popular in the 1970s, an electric typewriter whose type elements, rather than being attached to separate bars, rest on a single golfball
* Empedocles is mentioned throughout the Exegesis, along with other pre-Socratic thinkers, notably Heraclitus and Parmenides . Empedocles wrote two works, both lost, one on nature and the other called Katharmoi or Purifications . In a fragment of the latter, addressing himself to the citizens of Acragas in Sicily, Empedocles declares himself
* The Hymn of the Soul, also known as the Hymn of the Pearl, is a numinous fable of spiritual homecoming that captures, more than any narrative of antiquity, Dick's noetic vision of anamnesis . The Acts of Thomas was a third-century apocryphal Christian text, most likely of Syriac origin, but the hymn, sung by Thomas in prison, is clearly an interpolation . Though it shows the influence of the New Testament, some scholars think it is a Mesopotamian fairy tale, or possibly the remnant of a pre-Christian Gnostic tradition whose very existence remains controversial . Of particular importance for an understanding of Dick is the role of the letter; when the occluded hero breaks the seal ,
Making his way home, the hero finds the letter again ,
like a beer can or a piece of trash . (Later in the Exegesis, Dick discusses the Xerox missive in terms influenced by the Hymn, though the values are inverted .) Once home, the hero puts on holy robes that, in Barnstone's translation ,
and that mirror him like a divine twin :
two entities but one form.
