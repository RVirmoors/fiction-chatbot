* While Schrödinger discovered the informatic character of living systems, Dick predates the invention of the discipline of artificial life here by positing the possibly living and sentient character of information itself . Geophysicist Vladimir Vernadsky had already coined the term noösphere
* Linear time has a rather immediate purchase on our perception . Our finite experience of time—no moment can be simultaneous with any other moment—persuades us that moments actually follow one another . But Dick's experience of what he often describes as divine reality—eternal time in which moments overlap or superimpose themselves—was equally persuasive to him, forcing him to grapple with the possibility that what he had previously perceived as reality was in fact fiction or camouflage . In this passage, Dick floats the rather alarming and counterintuitive idea that the future could alter the present, and he does so by way of orthodox Christian theology, which in his view takes this rather science-fictional concept of time as doctrine . Crucially, Dick effects this movement to the eternal aspect of time through his perception of unity :
By making all of space and time—the Kingdom of Heaven—"one thing ,"Dick resolves the paradox of whether his experience is coming from within or without—a Möbius strip that provides further demonstration of the integration of inner outer
* In his later years Dick limited his drug use to scotch, snuff, and the occasional joint . In his teens, Dick was given the stimulant Semoxydrine as an antidepressant . Between 1952 and 1972, Dick became notorious for his prodigious use of amphetamines, which he reportedly consumed by the handful to keep up his nearly inhuman writing pace . In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dick's house in Santa Venetia became a well-known hangout for teenagers and eventually for serious addicts and pushers; Dick's experience with the drug scene is chronicled with humor and compassion in his novel A Scanner Darkly (1977). Though Dick's mescaline trip in May 1970 inspired Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, it is not true, as many believe, that Dick wrote while on LSD—a claim that Harlan Ellison made in his introduction to the Dick story
which appeared in his influential new wave SF collection Dangerous Visions (1967). Dick took LSD only two or three times, once suffering a terrible trip spent envisioning an angry god tormenting him
like a metaphysical IRS agent.
* Victoria Principal (1950-) is a Hollywood actress (Earthquake, Dallas) and one of Dick's many dark-haired girls.
* This is the book, published in 1969 by the pioneering parapsychologist Charley Tart, that introduced the phrase
* A contemplation of God's nature occupies virtually all of Dick's late-period work, but as he grapples with theology, what is startling are not the more far-fetched notions—anyone who has read Dick's earlier work expects these—but the more conventional ones . The God who reveals Himself in Dick's thinking often is very much the familiar humanized Judeo-Christian God . This God acts personally and responds personally in the ways of both the Old and New Testaments; note a few paragraphs earlier, in a passage that is practically biblical, the trust that Dick's God places in special men prophets . The upcoming reference to God/Jesus as Zebra
* With few exceptions, the Exegesis was not a journal where Dick would summarize his daily affairs . As a result, many of the crucial events of 2-3-74 were not written about as they happened, and so it is difficult to know how significant these events were for Dick when they transpired . One day before writing this letter to Claudia, Dick wrote a frantic letter to the FBI, saying that two days earlier (March 18) he had received a registered letter from Estonia, a letter he knew
He makes no mention of that here . Similarly, in a letter written to his daughter on March 17 , 1974, the day after vivid fire every thrall, he makes no mention of his life-changing circumstances . March 20 also appears to be the day Dick received the Xerox missive ,
* While this self-encounter occurs as an idea for a plot, it offers an uncanny description of Dick's own journey . Under the influence of his own writing, and by putting as much of himself as possible into that writing, Dick seems to have seen himself as an abstraction—not in the sense of a deadened thing taken out of its context, but in the sense that software engineers discuss layers of abstraction: an act of metacognition or description that at once detaches from and observes other layers of the system . In the Exegesis, Dick observed himself being what Douglas Hofstadter calls a strange loop . Dick later recognizes that this operation of meta-abstraction identifies something about reality—that the world itself is looped with the language we use to describe it . In The Divine Invasion, the child god Emmanuel manifests something like this loop when he performs the
* Doris Sauter was a dark-haired girl Dick met in 1972 when she was dating his friend (and fellow SF writer) Norman Spinrad . The two later bonded over their growing interest in Christianity, Doris sharing her conversion story with Dick, and Dick relaying the events of 2-3-74 to her . Eventually the two paired up for charity work . In May 1975, Sauter was diagnosed with advanced lymphatic cancer, which she survived . In January 1976, Dick asked Sauter to marry him (although his fifth wife, Tessa, and young son Christopher would not move out of the apartment for several months). Sauter refused . Later that year, when Sauter's cancer returned and Dick's health issues—including high blood pressure and heart problems—became more serious, they decided to live together . Doris became the character model for Sherri Solvig in VALIS (1981). Later she moved next door to Dick and became the inspiration for the character in Rybus Romney in
* It is not clear from the Exegesis to what extent Dick's path crossed with that of Theodore Sturgeon, the author of the science-fiction novels Venus Plus X and More Than Human, who herein is mentioned a number of times (as are the SF authors Thomas Disch, Ursula Le Guin, and Stanislaw Lem). Dick's and Sturgeon's outlaw kinship—their shared anarchic spirit, their common ambivalence about the technology that wowed most other science-fiction writers, their subversion of physical and temporal reality in pursuit of emotional or even metaphysical truths—makes sense considering that both aimed for the literary mainstream
* In passages like these, it is impossible to ignore Dick's obvious and sometimes self-confessed psychopathology—in other words, that the guy often appears, well, crazy . It is tempting to collapse Dick's mystical realizations into this craziness, as if Valis were nothing more than a symptom of Dick's alleged schizophrenia, temporal lobe seizures, or whatever . But we must be more careful, and more sophisticated, here . Dick himself thought poignantly and deeply about these and related issues and came to a conclusion that many other thoughtful people—from William James and Henri Bergson to Aldous Huxley—have come to, namely, that the brain may be a kind of filter, transmitter, reducer
* Such lines announce a continuous meta-theme in Dick's Exegesis—what I have elsewhere called the mytheme of Mutation . This is the notion that paranormal powers and mystical experiences are expressions of the emerging buds or limbs of an evolving human supernature . Although this idea was endlessly explored in the pulp fiction of the 1940s and 1950s, found some of its most sophisticated mystical expressions in the human potential movement, and later found a wide popular audience in the counterculture with its mutant X-Men, it is much older than all of these . Indeed, the idea's deepest roots lie in elite academic British culture, and more especially in the London Society for Psychical Research (founded 1882), with figures like the Cambridge classicist Frederic Myers, who saw psychical abilities like telepathy (a word that he coined) as supernormal extraterrene evolution.
* Dick consistently seeks to uncover some trace of the so-called unwritten doctrine that Aristotle associates with Plato in the Physics, an association that some see as outing Plato as a secret Pythagorean for whom ultimate reality is revealed by number . Dick also seeks to identify Plato's doctrine of the forms with Parmenides's idea of being as a well-rounded sphere opposed to the nothingness of nonbeing . This notion seems linked in Dick's mind with another borrowing from Parmenides to which he makes frequent allusion, the famous fragment 3 :
Also important to Heidegger, whose radical interpretations of the pre-Socratics may have influenced Dick, this fragment identifies the activity of intellection, noesis or noös, with the essential being of things . We might also take one further step and cite Empedocles's fragment 28, which appears to allude to Parmenides :
* In his extraordinary German sermons, Meister Eckhart (1260–1327) described the kingdom in the soul as the divine spark (vünkelîn), a term that appears elsewhere in the Exegesis . He also called this kingdom the godhead (gôtheit). Such views were condemned by the Avignon Pope as heretical two years after Eckhart's death . Eckhart's heresy was considered close to the much-feared Heresy of the Free Spirit that, some historians claim, was like an invisible empire across Europe in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries . The core of this heresy consisted in the denial of original sin: sin does not lie within us, but within the world, which is not the creation of the true God, but of the malevolent demiurge . Therefore, we must see through the evil illusion of this world to the true world of the alien God . We might link this to Dick's view that orthogonal time will make it possible for the golden age—the time before the fall—to return . In the text of Eckhart's papal condemnation, we find quasi-gnostic utterances such as :
All this can be linked to Dick's later Eckhartean allusion to humans as
corruptible sheaves around divine sparks.
* Dick's approach to the concept of being born again is quite different from the interpretation that developed among evangelical Protestants in the twentieth century . For evangelicals, being born again depends on a personal decision, an intellectual/emotional acceptance of a soteriological proposition . For Dick, it refers to a passive event, an invasion—possibly even a victimization—by an outside force . Dick's second birth exegesis
* The introduction of Zebra brings us close to the center of Dick's mystical vision . With the discovery of Zebra as a mimicker of forms, Dick thinks that he has found his deus absconditus— his hidden God concealed in the phenomenal world . Elsewhere, Zebra is described as a cosmic Christ and as a giant brain that utilizes us as crossing stations in his vast relay network of living information . Chains of associated identifications structure the argument of the Exegesis: Zebra equals Christ, and Christ equals God; the mind's union with Zebra is the union with God, where
The kernel of Dick's mystical heresy
* After searching in reference books and other sources for analogies to his experiences in 2-3-74, Dick now seems to accept that it may be unique, or nearly so . The discovery is no doubt bittersweet: if others have had similar experiences, his vision would be validated; but if not, his status as a lone visionary is enhanced even more . There is, of course, another way to interpret the realization that an explanation
* Much of the 1977 Exegesis is taken up with pages like these, in which whole encyclopedia entries are copied out by hand . Taken together they provide a fascinating map of autodidactic study; Dick is led from one thing to the next not to master a field of study or a philosophical system but to try to figure out his own experience . The hunger for legitimacy in these passages is striking—no less an authority than Hegel agrees with him! —but no more so than the insistence with which he returns again and again to ground the inquiry in his own experience and need to understand . Dick was well aware of the idiosyncratic and unauthorized nature of his intellectual quest, as VALIS in particular shows . The novel piles up sources and citations from Dick's own researches while posing the question of whether the path of Horselover Fat leads to anywhere but the nuthouse . But what the novel does—what it both intends to do and actually does—is extend an invitation . As Fat's shrink tells him at a low point ,
* In November 1971, Dick's San Rafael house was burglarized . The intruders used explosives to blow open Dick's fireproof safe . Manuscripts and canceled checks were stolen along with a stereo and a gun . Dick speculated for years about the identity and motivation of the intruders; in many ways this endless theorizing prefigures 2-3-74 and his writing of the Exegesis . Dick would construct an elaborate theory about the burglary, complete with motivation and method, only to cast his carefully crafted theory aside when another entered his mind . From Paul Williams's Rolling Stone profile, it appears that Dick's obsession with the event grew over time and eventually began to take over his life . The most Dickian suggestion was made by the police: Dick had committed the burglary himself . When Dick could no longer get the police to return his phone calls, he fell into another depression, writing to Williams, probably only partially in jest ,
Ever since the police lost interest in me, there's been nothing to live for.
* Among all of Dick's books, including the important
* With this important concept, Dick presents the visible universe as a moral test . The challenge is to perceive the injustice of the system of the world and to refuse to cooperate with it . The problem is that the logic of the visible universe is internally consistent and contains no clear indication that it deserves to be rejected . The impetus to withdraw assent must come from a transcendent point of view that impels immediate disobedience: the word balk implies gut instinct rather than intellectual decision . Moreover, one cannot be aware that the visible universe is a test, because this would lead to calculated action in light of an expected reward . Dick gives one concrete example of his own balking: his participation in the tax strike organized by Ramparts magazine in 1968 . By this-worldly standards, this was an illogical decision that led to personal hardship, but by other-worldly
* The flip side of these feelings of self-importance was, for Dick, debilitating paranoia . Many of Dick's theories placed him at the center of vast, cosmic scenarios, and these preoccupations were often coupled with feelings of persecution . An exaggerated sense of self-importance is common among paranoiacs, who often reason that they must be important if people are out to get them . In a speech to a Vancouver science-fiction convention in 1972, Dick famously noted that any formulation
* Discreet Music is the album I've listened to most often in the past thirty-five years since buying it when it was released in 1975 . Brian Eno (affectionately also called Brain One
* In this extraordinary passage, the recursive, self-referential quality of the Exegesis goes loopy . The Exegesis is an exegesis after all, which means that it is obsessed with commentary and Talmudic cross-referencing . In addition to Dick's interminable analysis of his own corpus, there is his regular use of footnotes, which here go haywire . At the top of the page Dick places an asterisk that refers to a small chunk of related text, between which lies the brief description of a dream in which Dick opens one of his own books and discovers a footnote that reads :
Dick then parenthetically defines the term gloss as a difficult term needing explanation, a definition that nonetheless requires another explanation, a footnote now using his usual bracketed numeral (1). This footnote offers a variant reading of the meaning of gloss, defining it not as the explanation of an obscure term—rather like the explanation that you, reader, are now reading—but instead the obscure term itself—in this case, the cypher-text Felix . A parenthetical amendment about the Greek variant glossa in turn spawns another reference mark, a circled ⊗ that leads to yet another repetitive definition . Finally, Dick reiterates that Felix is such a glossa: a glossy obscurity whose invisible message is, at least in its original context ,
* This passage reveals much about the logic of the Exegesis and rewards close scrutiny . Here Dick is in great joy: the masterful A Scanner Darkly is hot off the press, and Stevie Nicks is in the headphones . (It must be Dreams) Yet only one page before, Dick is in full metaphysical despair . He scribbles a lamentation in German; the second half is drawn from Bach's Cantata BWV 140, Sleepers Awake . At the bottom of that page, as an unnumbered footnote, he declares that this prayer had been answered when he subsequently stumbled across the Britannica entry on Jacob Boehme . Though it is hard to imagine how one reads an encyclopedia passage by mistake, this random access is important to Dick because it removes his will from the equation, implying cosmic intention . In other words, God answered his lament by guiding him to Boehme, in whom he discovered a secret sympathy across time . However, this whole episode is complicated by the appearance sixty-four pages earlier (entry 50:19 above) of the unusual phrase
* Dick is likely referring to Colossians 1:18–20, which states that
More specifically, Dick is probably referring to the footnotes in the Jerusalem Bible, a Catholic translation first published in 1966 and containing extensive theological annotations written by a committee of Jesuit scholars . Dick frequently quotes from this version's footnotes, suggesting that it was his preferred study Bible (though he is also known to have owned an annotated copy of the New Testament in the New English Version). The notes for this passage of Colossians declare that Christ is
head not only of the entire human race, but of the entire created cosmos, so that everything that was involved in the fall is equally involved in the salvation.
* While the Exegesis is largely concerned with Western philosophy, Western religion, and Western science, Dick was strongly influenced by his (rather typically Californian) encounter with the East . Hinduism gave him a powerful language in which to think about the absolute and the problem of illusion; his embrace of paradox, organic process, and the lowly was deeply marked by his reading of Zen and Taoism, and especially his obsessive use of the I Ching—the ancient Chinese book of changes . The I Ching uses a binary system—yin and yang, broken and solid lines, respectively—to express and model the myriad phases of growth and decay . Like many oracles in Dick's fiction (including The Man in the High Castle, which was partly written using the I Ching), the book's messages—a mixture of Taoist, Confucian, and shamanic lore—are accessed through the throw of coins or other randomizing techniques . Indeed, with its computer-like code, its relentless oscillation of opposites, and its reliance on synchronicity, the I Ching gave Dick an early experience of an organic and mystical information entity—Valis before the name . Here the two hexagrams depict the trash dialectic that so concerned Dick, graphically figured through the loss and return of a single yang line between the two figures . In the Wilhelm/Baynes edition that Dick regularly used, the movement between these two hexagrams is described thus :
When what is above is completely split apart, it returns below.
* The Invisible Landscape (1975) was Terence and Dennis McKenna's attempt to theorize the bizarre high-dose psilocybin experiences they underwent in the Colombian Amazon in 1971 . As Dick notes, their text shares many concerns with the Exegesis, which should remind us that Dick was hardly alone in his heady speculations . Throughout the 1970s, Robert Anton Wilson, Timothy Leary, Jack Sarfatti, and many others explored a mode of associative and interdisciplinary theorizing that combined weird science, psychoactive inspiration, occult semiotics, and what can only be called garage philosophy . While sometimes resembling the isolated and obsessional literature of cranks and conspiracy theorists, these speculations also served an underground social function by bringing heads together through a shared language and style . A moment later here, Dick writes, with good reason, that he lived out the process the McKennas described, while Terence later proclaimed, in the afterword to Lawrence Sutin's 1991 abridgement of the Exegesis :
* Between 1947 and 1951, Dick worked for Herb Hollis at University Radio and later at Art Music in Berkeley, jobs that helped him make the difficult transition from awkward teenager to self-sufficient adult . A straitlaced father figure, Hollis served as a kind of mentor for Dick, while his coworkers served as models for Dick's future characters . Whether with the futuristic ad agency in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, the family-run android business in We Can Build You, or the anti-telepathy Prudence Organizations in Ubik, Dick's fiction constantly recasts his formative years working for Hollis, often focusing on the plight of a small business operation struggling against a more powerful, but less upstanding, competition . In 1977 Dick told interviewer Uwe Anton that
Dick's thematic concern for the little guy ,
* Dick's higher and lower realms mirror the important distinction he draws in his fiction between man and machine . While machines are predictable, man is not; moreover, the machine is cold and unfeeling, cut off from the plight of those around it . Similarly, in the Exegesis the lower realm is incapable of empathy . Like an android programmed to react in a predetermined way, the spurious world is a deterministic maze
* Here again we meet Dick's mystical mutants . More importantly, we see the multiple influences that helped shape his zapped imagination of these figures . First, we see a book, Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier's The Morning of the Magicians (originally Les Matins des Magiciens , 1960), which employed the tropes of mutants, superhumans, even Superman, to advance a countercultural occultism inspired largely by the books of the American Charles Fort . Second, we see the importance of Dick's auditions, psychical experiences (the tutelary telepathic link), and dreams, and their profound influence on his writing life . Also significant here is the fact that the first American edition of The Morning of the Magicians was published by Avon, the same publisher that would later publish an edition of Dick's Radio Free Albemuth . In short, we see here within Dick's paperback world a mind-bending feedback mechanism or loop of pop culture and altered states of consciousness arcing back on itself through countless acts of reading, dreaming, and writing: a morphing superconsciousness published or made public
* Here Dick nails two crucial features of the paranormal: (1) the fantastic or both-and paradoxical structure of its appearances, which leave the reader, and even the experiencer, in a state of profound hesitation or confusion over the event's reality; and (2) the manner in which these paradoxical events organize themselves around narrative, story, or, to be more traditional about it, myth . Hence Dick's secret narrative comes first to shape reality, even the physical universe, around its patterns and meanings . Seen in this light, it is a serious mistake to approach a paranormal experience with an up-down vote, as if it were a simple object out there that could be measured and controlled . This is to miss its wildly living function and fierce message, which are all about pulling us into its own drama and shattering our either-or thinking through story and symbol . In short, the paranormal is about paradox, not proof; about meaning, not mechanism; about myth, not math . Most of all, however, the paranormal is about the coincidence or fundamental unity of mind and matter . Two of Dick's favorite scholars captured this truth in two Latin sound bites: the mysterium conjunctionis, or
of C. G. Jung and the coincidentia oppositorum, or
* Dick's fiction establishes an unusually strong connection between the author and his characters, and specifically his protagonists: men who are down on their luck and forced to encounter, once again, the inscrutable apathy of the universe . These characters give voice to Dick's own existential concerns; his third wife, Anne, called his writing surrealist autobiography . In a 1970 letter to SF Commentary, Dick wrote ,
* Dick is often read by literary scholars as a postmodern writer . Postmodernism is a complex of concepts that assert that all our constructs are just that, constructs; that there are no grand narratives or abiding truths; that all such grand narratives are illegitimate power moves; and that every perspective is necessarily a limited and local one . Here Dick realizes that such a way of thinking, which he himself has championed in dozens of novels, is a half-truth, in the sense that its claims rely on a non-duped subjectivity and a privileged claim, which, ironically, is itself a grand narrative or abiding truth . Dick, then, was finally no postmodern thinker, not at least in the sense in which that label is commonly understood . In his own mind at least, his body of work constituted both a demonstration that the sensory and social world is an illusory simulation and a revelation of another order of mind and being from outside this maze of cognitive and cultural tricks . As Dick puts it later on in the Exegesis :
Valis proves there is an outside.
