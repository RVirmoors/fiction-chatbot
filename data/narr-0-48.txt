in the field), Kantian philosophy (
), and literary studies (the hermeneutic fusion of interpreter and interpreted) in order to suggest that such a both-and situation points to vast potentials and powers . The real question, of course, is what constitutes those certain circumstances under which these potential powers might manifest . Dick's own certain circumstances had a name :
* Despite his idea that this is a new revelation, Dick is close here to Teilhard de Chardin's concept of the Omega Point, whereby the material world evolves toward spiritual communion . While Teilhard writes of the increasing complexity of evolution, Dick here writes of negentropy, a concept first developed by Erwin Schrödinger to describe the effort of living systems to create order to offset their production of entropy . While thermodynamics compels all closed systems to dissipate exergy (useful energy), living systems seem to increase order in the course of development; in Schrödinger's terminology, they feed upon negentropy . Significantly, Schrödinger turned to the Vedic concept of Brahman or Self to make sense of an important local instance of negentropy—his own consciousness . Dick's treatment of reality as a
also anticipates the cellular automata models of physicist Stephen Wolfram, though the model goes back at least to John von Neumann's 1947 discussion of
* Joachim of Fiore, a twelfth-century theologian, was the most influential apocalyptic thinker of the medieval period . He believed the world was on the verge of a golden age in which all men would be monks in direct communion with God . This third age would be governed by the Holy Spirit, replacing the earlier ages of the strict Father and the intermediary Son . Though Joachim himself does not seem to have considered himself a revolutionary—indeed, he only wrote his ideas down at the urging of the pope—his followers in later centuries were often sharply anticlerical, and some were antinomians and anarchists . It's easy to see how his idea of a procession of ages leading from subjugation to absolute freedom could have revolutionary applications . Though he does mention religious anarchists ,
that is, mythical or sacred time, as in the stock phrases in the beginning Mircea Eliade used the expression to refer to traditional religious attempts to escape or annul profane time (understood here as linear temporality or what we now call history) and return to the sacred time referenced in myth and reenacted in religious ritual . Always capable of being remembered and so reactualized (hence Dick's constant invocation of anamnesis) within the narratives of myth and the actions of ritual (like the Eucharist), sacred time is essentially no-time or beyond time . We might say, then, that what Eliade imagined in his comparative theorizing Dick seems to have realized in his experience of Valis . But this may be much too simple, as Eliade once noted that his own dissertation researches and early experiments with yoga taught him
* This folder is over three hundred pages long and combines handwritten notes, beginning with number 498, and typed, dated pieces . Dick grouped these into sections marked I through XVIII, a Roman numbering system that continues for several more folders . Because of the complexities introduced, we have opted to use sheet numbers beginning with 1 . This folder begins with a conceptual breakthrough about meta abstraction and peaks with a theophany on November 17 , 1980, which appears at [1:262] below . At the close of that extensive entry, Dick writes the resounding word END
is crucial because it captures the way in which Valis is simultaneously something that Dick experienced in the freedom of his own consciousness and something that seemed to happen to him . And what happened to him, here at least, was One thing . Plotinus's One is consonant with that other philosopher of the Perennial Philosophy, Sankara, who referred to reality as
In other words, despite appearances, everything we perceive in the world, including ourselves, has the attribute of unity . This is both a message—"Monistic Newsflash: Tomatoes, Tomahtoes, It's All One!
—and a feeling: the self becomes an attribute of something immeasurably larger than itself . This insight is at once immensely obvious and notoriously ineffable: one either perceives the unity of all things or not, and Dick very much has . The experiences of aha
† The terms reticulation and arborizing explain the meshed and often baroque nature of reality, which is, pace the Talking Heads' David Byrne, the
Apparently destroyed by its transformation into bits of information, the collective remains whole as
another level of abstract topology that integrates the apparently chaotic multiplicity of the world through an infolding, outfolding, and branching of reality that resembles physicist David Bohm's notion of the implicate order out of which all of reality emerges . Focusing our attention on this reticulation, as Dick does, affects reality itself via the noösphere :
As regards my writing: it will permanently affect the macrometasomakosmos in the form of reticulation and arborizing—and hence will survive in reality forever, in the underlying structure of the world order.
* Just as the manifestation of Valis is one of organizations, patterns of meaning, neural networks, and the collapse of temporal and spatial boundaries—that is, just as Valis is a revelation of hyperconnections—so too now works the radiated mind of Dick himself . Dick has in effect become a super-comparativist, and so he is able to draw connections and organize disparate patterns of information, like Valis, through huge stretches of space and time . And why not? Paradoxically, Valis works through history and yet exists, as a hyperdimensional presence, outside the box of history . This abolishing of time is especially evident in the history of religions and, more precisely, comparative mystical literature, to whose patterns and similarities Dick is powerfully drawn . In this particular passage, the double-edged sword of the comparative imagination is evident: bits of truth can indeed be found everywhere, but the full truth is nowhere to be found; religious systems are both true (as approximations or reflections) and false (as final and complete answers) at the same time . Today a much simpler form of this double-notion is crystallized in the oft-heard quip
Such a position is often demeaned as fuzzy, as narcissistic, as New Agey.
* Among the many exotic and ominous diagnoses that may be proposed by those inclined to put Dick's visions into a medical or neurological framework, one simple and relatively benign description hides everywhere in plain sight . Micropsia
* The following description of Dick's November 17 , 1980, theophany is arguably the single most important entry in the entire Exegesis: it offers a fully developed interpretation of Dick's mode of theoretical exploration, expressed in some of the most beautiful prose he ever wrote . In the face of despair at the interminability of his theological exploration, Dick meets a vision of a God at play: this entire theological exercise is presented as a game between omnipotent deity and created being . Moreover, the infinitude of Dick's theories itself becomes proof that God is the beginning and end of his experiences . In light of the ideas presented in the theophany itself, Dick's conclusions at the end of the entry—that 2-3-74 was caused by Satan and that the Exegesis is therefore a diabolical hell-chore
* The visionary episode of November 17 , 1980, is one of the peaks of the Exegesis, as sublime a modern parable as Kafka 's
These pages are also bona fide mysticism—not because Dick had authentic mystical experiences (whatever those are) but because Dick produced powerful texts that twist and illuminate vital strands of mystical discourse . Here we are in the apophatic realm of the via negativa, which, like Dick's game-playing God, deconstructs all names and forms in the obscure light of the infinite . Elsewhere Dick tips his hat to Eckhart and Erigena, but the apophatic mystic his writing most invokes here is Nicholas of Cusa (1401-1464). By analyzing paradoxes, Cusa pushed reason toward a learned ignorance
* Not surprisingly, Philip K. Dick scholars have been keen to defend the author against the popular (and also understandable) stereotype that he was just a druggy . It's true that Dick gobbled pills and drank amphetamine shakes; his psychedelic use, though infrequent, was also important, as was the nitrous oxide trip at the dentist's office that revealed Valis
Here, the quaint reference to Mary Jane
* Dick focuses on agape, a Greek term for total love, as a guideline for navigating those realities that are enmeshed with our thoughts about them . Agape calls us to cherish beings for what they are, and for nothing else . Over and over, Dick insists that his monistic vision is not pantheism, for his vision depends upon the very difference between self and other, world and the divine, that makes agape possible . Nondualistic in its essence, agape acts like a kind of mantra whose very utterance makes us quiver or stridulate in a vibrational intensity of self-other interaction . Agape makes us say it out loud, act like a fool, not knowing what is up or down, inside or out . It welcomes what Dick elsewhere calls the
* A lot of Dick's cosmology boils down to loving and being loved, something that was difficult for him throughout his life and especially his five marriages . Dick's writing often depicts his own struggle to open up and make himself vulnerable to the people around him . In his 1975 essay
* Even in his most megalomaniac moments Dick never suggests that the Exegesis itself will ever be read . But the fact that, improbably, we are reading these lines gives the question he poses here and elsewhere—what is the value of all this thinking? —a certain urgency for us as well . If the Exegesis is his delusion and hell-chore ,
* Dick's take (or one of his takes, at least) on the question of law and grace is not too dissimilar from that of John Calvin, who distinguished between the Hebrew Bible's covenant of works and the New Testament 's
In Dick's formulation, the Torah is an all-too-strict mechanistic system, based on an inflexible equation of transgression and punishment . As elsewhere, Dick is preoccupied with determinism, which he considers an evil; love/grace/mercy breaks through the requirements of normal causality . Compare this statement on the rigidity of Torah with Dick's comment in the essay
that the android mind is characterized by
the inability to make exceptions.
* One of the great charms of the Exegesis is the presence of Dick's ballpoint diagrams, which remind me of the blackboard drawings that Rudolf Steiner sketched during his metaphysical lectures . Most of Dick's drawings are abstract illustrations—flow charts, Venn diagrams, intersecting 3-D planes—that lend a concrete form to his ever-mutating conceptual schemas . But others focus on the fish sign, his persistent icon of downloading divinity . Formally, the shape invokes the vesica piscis or mandorla, a geometric pattern often found in the almond-shaped auras of Christian iconography . Variations appear throughout the Exegesis, where the fish morphs into everything from a third eye to a vagina dentata to the mysterious whale mouth sign of Albemuth . This doodle shows a distinct development of the form, which, according to a February 14 , 1978, letter to Ira Einhorn, reflects its original visionary disclosure as a
from fish to one-eyed mandorla to spiral DNA . Like most sacred geometric forms, the power of Dick's fish sign lies partly in its Platonic
* Given Dick's leap into what he calls meta-abstraction, it is perhaps predictable that he would imagine a life form that, rather than embodying information in a substrate, is pure information itself . The conceptual trajectory he traces here grew steadily in Western scientific culture from the 1930s to the 1990s, drawing in genetics (DNA as the information carrier and the book of life
* In this passage, Dick anticipates some of the most revolutionary physics of the late twentieth century, especially Edward Fredkin's idea that underlying quantum mechanics and particle physics is a digital substructure, from which the former phenomena emerge as a result of its computations . There is an interesting tension between imagining the computer as the lowest, most fundamental level of reality, which is Fredkin's position, and Dick's vision here that the computer is somehow above the phenomenal world . While one may suppose that Dick's meta-computer would be the ultimate cognitive machine (hence Dick's identification of it with God
‡ Dick's claim for the
strikes me as astute, if immodest . This reminds us again how Dick's late-life novelistic triumphs in VALIS and Transmigration, as well as in A Scanner Darkly earlier, depend on his reintegration of his abandoned mainstream aspirations and therefore display anamnesis of his earlier study of his would-be midcentury cohort . In a 1962 letter he advised an aspiring science fiction writer :
Avoid other people interested in writing.
* Dick is no more a philosopher or theologian than were Vincent van Gogh or L. Ron Hubbard . Dick was one of the most important American novelists of the last half of the twentieth century, and what he offered wasn't the clarity and rigor of a philosophical vision but the imagination and ambiguity of a literary one . The philosophy is erratic, even crackpot; but joined to the act of storytelling—and more importantly, joined to the act of creating characters as fucked up as their author—the result was a synthesis of imagination and idea that spoke more profoundly than any philosophy
* After seven years of spinning an astonishing plethora of theories, the fact that Dick can now admit to his failure workable explanation is remarkable . His insight here that the abstract emerges from the noisy particulars of the world, rather than, as in the Platonic model, from an ideal reality of which empirical reality is a flawed copy, is a growing realization in science studies as well . In How the Laws of Physics Lie (1983) Nancy Cartwright argues that all that ever actually exists is the noise of the world, from which scientific laws are abstracted . In a very different sense, contemporary interpretations of quantum mechanics provide similar insights . Nobel Prize winner Murray Gell-Mann and his collaborator James Hartle have proposed that in the quantum fog represented as probability clouds, certain consistent world histories decohere (assume definite trajectories) and stabilize at a coarse-grained level of reality larger than the quantum scale . We might analogize their vision to tiny demons knitting the fabric of the universe according to different instructions . As such, the stabilities that constitute scientific laws
* This passage presents a supernaturalist theory of divine action: Christ acts on the world only by miracle, and never as a result of predictable, materialist, or mechanical causes . More fundamentally, however, it shows Dick's preoccupation with freedom from determinism: Christ is not constrained by the same forces that limit created beings and objects . He is an effect without a cause . We see this same rejection of determinism throughout the Exegesis: even when presenting reality as a moral test with a right
* Here we see Dick's impulse toward synthesis shift into hyperdrive; he assembles multiple systems of thought and references as if they can be seamlessly joined without contradiction . What we gain from such a loose assemblage is a vague sense that these multiple systems have something in common, but the details of exactly how they can be articulated together remain elusive . For example, Capra argues that the field model of quantum mechanics posits the field as the fundamental entity in reality, in which the appearance of particles can be understood as knots
* Here Dick compares the binary forking model (derived from a computational model of the universe) to the two slit experiment that famously demonstrated that electrons can manifest as both waves and particles . When electrons are beamed at a single slit behind which sits a detector screen, they manifest as particles . However, when a second slit is added, interference waves appear . Depending on the experimental setup, then, electrons can appear as either waves or particles . Dick's analogy is based on the indeterminacy that a binary forking model and the two-slit model both imply . Subatomic particles demonstrate an indeterminacy expressed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, in which the momentum and position cannot be co-specified with an accuracy greater than Planck's constant . With the binary forking model, indeterminacy arises because of the complexity of interactions between multiple independent agents acting simultaneously, as in a cellular automata model . In the former case, the observer becomes implicated in the supposedly objective
* For all its eccentricity, the Exegesis is ultimately a rational exercise: Dick develops a hypothesis, applies its framework to his experience, and examines how well the theory fits the facts of his experience (or at least his current shaping of those facts). Dick was never a writer of hard science fiction, and his stories don't generally adhere to a strict standard of scientific plausibility . But here he applies a loose variation on the scientific method to explain and rationalize his experiences . In this respect, the Exegesis shows more scientific
* The assertion that Dick's last three novels, in many (important) ways so divergent, should be read as a trilogy is annoying, to me anyway . As novels, they simply don't add up that way (nor is Divine Invasion at the level of the other two), yet the term sticks; here, Dick shows unmistakable investment in it himself . On the one hand, keep in mind that in the wake of Star Wars and Tolkien, what publishers called Sci-Fi briefly enjoyed a weird boom that made best-sellers out of some of the long-suffering writers Dick could view as peers—Robert Silverberg, Philip Jose Farmer, Frank Herbert, and others—and that nearly all of their commercial hits were in the form of declared trilogies
* Here Dick confronts one of the fundamental debates in the philosophy of mysticism . On the one hand, some modern thinkers assert that mystical experience—here rendered in the language of the human potential movement as Maslow's peak experiences —enables us to transcend conceptual thought and to directly glimpse reality as it is . In contrast, more skeptical voices insist that mystical experience is, like everything else, a construction; our groks are mediated by cultural expectations, conceptual filters (including linguistic signs), and the peculiarities imposed by the structures of human consciousness . Here Dick embraces this latter Kantian argument, but pushes it in the direction of more traditional claims of revelation . Peak experiences are not real in themselves, but neither are they simply projections or hiccups of the individual mind . Like everything else, experiences are signs . But through meta-abstraction, we can intuit them as a special kind of sign: an ultra-real (or hyper-real) sign that points, not back to our own language or neural hardwiring, but to an ineffable ground that eludes both words and
* When Dick claims that The Transmigration of Timothy Archer is his best novel, in and of itself the statement is meaningless because every writer wants to believe this about his most recent work . So it's profoundly satisfying, in no small part because the book will prove to be his last novel as well, that one can make as compelling a case for Transmigration as for The Man in the High Castle or Ubik or A Scanner Darkly . Paradoxically, for all its theology and philosophical aspirations, and for all the visionary craziness of Dick's work as a whole, Transmigration becomes a contender for his masterpiece even as it's the most earthbound of his books . The reason is clear . Though Dick is fascinated at the outset with Bishop Timothy Archer, Angel Archer takes over . Over and over Dick argues that Angel is just a creation of style, which is why in a nutshell authors shouldn't waste two seconds trying to understand their own books . Elsewhere he lets out the real secret and the Exegesis's bombshell: that Angel is his twin sister Jane . Smart, sardonic, and unsentimental, strong and compassionate and unflaggingly honest, surrounded by death and suicide, she is Dick's greatest character, pursuing salvation and reliving its revelations, and concluding ,
You will remember the ground again.
* This is an impossibly rich passage in which the theme of eucharistic transubstantiation (the blood of Christ) is linked to Valis (the plasmate), a kind of human-divine hybridization (the interspecies symbiosis and cross-bonding), and the dual-brain Double God (Ditheon), all of which are in turn linked to the registers of sexual union (the hierogamy or sacred marriage

* The mind-body split here allows the formulation of two seemingly distinct entities (mind on the one hand, body on the other) to be worked into an analogy of humans as mind, ecosphere as body . Thus the poisoning of the ecosphere becomes the mind poisoning the body, without which it too will perish . Dick realizes, on the contrary, that mind and body are an indivisible whole . It therefore follows that the poisoning of the ecosphere means that it is his body being wounded by the activity of other humans, a conclusion consistent with his view of himself as an avatar or surrogate of Christ . The connections here are implicit rather than explicit, but they help to explain why he sees the
